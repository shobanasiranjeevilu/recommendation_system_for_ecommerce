Business problem:

In our daily lives, we encounter numerous products on digital platforms, and selecting one from the many options can be overwhelming. Reviews help customers make informed choices by providing feedback from previous users in the form of ratings and comments. While ratings are straightforward, reviews require a more detailed analysis to determine whether they convey a positive or negative sentiment.

Solution Proposed:

To address the challenge of customers being overwhelmed with product choices, Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology can be used for sentiment analysis of customer reviews, which can then be used for collaborative filtering to suggest similar products.For new customers who have not left reviews, the PageRank algorithm can be used to show them the most popular products on their homepage.
